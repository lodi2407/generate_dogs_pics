## How to use
- You need to have a DALLE account with credits
- You need to create a .env file containing the variable : `VITE_Open_AI_Key = {KEY}` -- Replace {KEY} by your generated API KEY from OPEN AI (https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/account-setup)
- To test the project, you can find a file called "dogsBreed.txt" at the root of the repository, then you just have to write dogs breed seperate by a comma and click on generate. If you check the "Automatically download images", all generated images will be upload on your computer one by one.
